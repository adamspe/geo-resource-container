<div>
    <p>Each feature added to the system must have an id that identifies it uniquely
        within its layer.</p>
    <p>If this layer is updated in the future (e.g. boundaries re-defined) it may be
        desireable to allow the feature data to be updated in place rather than
        recreated.  For example if other entities are to be associated with a given feature
        to prevent data integrity problems.</p>
    <p>The property format syntax is basic <code>sprintf</code> format without <thead>
        surrounding <code>&quot;</code> characters.  Unlike standard <code>sprintf</code>
        you can wrap optional properties in <code>[]</code>.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em> If your features had a unique property, <code>GEOID</code> that
        is guaranteed to remain constant moving forward you could specify a format
        like <code>%s,GEOID</code>.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em> If your features had two properties then when put together
        would guarantee uniqueness, and remain constant moving forward, you could
        specify a format like <code>%s.%s,MAINID,SUBID</code>.</p>
