<div>
    <p>The properties below represent the superset of all available properties
        across all features within your new layer.  Displayed values are pulled
        from first feature to have the given property set.</p>

    <p>Properties flagged with the <i class="fa fa-key" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        icon have values that are unique across all features within your new layer.</p>

    <p>If a property has an explicit type (e.g. <code>string</code>,<code>number</code>
        or <code>boolean</code>) then this indicates the property is available
        on all features and has a consistent type across them.</p>

    <p>A property type of <code>mixed</code> almost certainly indicates that
        property in question is either unset or is <code>null</code>
        for some features.</p>
