<div>
    <p>Each feature added to the system should have a friendly name to identify it.
        Feature names are generated from each feature's properties.</p>
    <p>The property format syntax is basic <code>sprintf</code> format without <thead>
        surrounding <code>&quot;</code> characters.  Unlike standard <code>sprintf</code>
        you can wrap optional properties in <code>[]</code>.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em> If your features had a unique property, <code>UNITNAME</code> that
        is guaranteed to remain constant moving forward you could specify a format
        like <code>%s,UNITNAME</code>.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em> If your features had two properties then when put together
        would create a more meaningful feature name, but one of the two properties
        is not always available (not unique, type <code>mixed</code>), you might
        specify a format like <code>%s[ (%s)],UNITNAME,SUBUNITNAME</code>.</p>
